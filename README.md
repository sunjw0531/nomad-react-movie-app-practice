# nomad react movie app practice
 <p>Using React for making a simple movie app. For now, css has not been applied. <br/>I made it by using react, prop-types, react router, gh-pages and some open APIs </p>

 <h1>Stack</h1>
<img alt="React" src ="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=FFFFFF"/> &nbsp;

 <h1>Todo</h1>
 <p>Need to apply the css and make it more like other movie info app.</p>
